# tran-SAS

The tran-SAS package includes a set of MATLAB codes to compute 
catchment-scale hydrologic transport using StorAge Selection (SAS) 
functions. The model addresses the transport of a conservative solute 
through a hydrologic system (e.g., a catchment or a lysimeter) and 
computes streamflow age and concentration.  

The package is introduced and discussed in: 
Benettin, P., & Bertuzzo, E. (2018). tran-SAS v1.0: a numerical model 
to compute catchment-scale hydrologic transport using StorAge Selection 
functions. Geoscientific Model Development, 11(4), 1627–1639.

A theoretical overview of the approach can be found in: Rinaldo, A., 
Benettin, P., Harman, C. J., Hrachowitz, M., McGuire, K. J., van 
der Velde, Y., Bertuzzo, E., and Botter, G. (2015). Storage 
selection functions: A coherent framework for quantifying 
how catchments store and release water and solutes. Water Resources 
Research, 51(6), 4840–4847. http://doi.org/10.1002/2015WR017273  


The code is compatible with all MATLAB versions after R2010a.
