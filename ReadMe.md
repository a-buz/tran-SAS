## R tran-SAS
A rewrite of the [`tran-SAS`](https://github.com/pbenettin/tran-SAS) package into `R`.

The aim of the package is to model the transport a conservative solute (e.g. stable isotopes) and compute streamflow concentration and age.

It is currently incomplete. So far only the Euler-Forward scheme and Beta distribution sampling has been added. The other features will be added soon.
